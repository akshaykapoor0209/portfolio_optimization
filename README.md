In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of five stocks listed on the London Stock Exchange using Microsoft Excel. Firstly, I gathered historical price data for each stock and calculated their respective returns over a specified period. Utilizing this data, I determined the expected return and volatility for each company, essential metrics for assessing risk and potential reward.

Next, I investigated the correlations between the returns of these assets. Understanding how the movements of one stock relate to those of others is crucial for constructing a diversified portfolio that effectively manages risk. I employed appropriate Solver functions within Excel to optimize the portfolio composition, balancing risk and return to achieve a target level of performance. By doing so, I generated the efficient frontier curve, illustrating the trade-offs between risk and return for various portfolio allocations.

Moreover, I employed linear regression analysis to calculate the beta coefficient for each asset in the portfolio. Beta measures the sensitivity of an asset's returns to market movements, providing insights into its systematic risk. Understanding the significance of beta helps investors assess how each stock contributes to the overall risk of the portfolio.

Furthermore, I estimated the Value at Risk (VaR) at a 5% confidence level for the portfolio. VaR quantifies the maximum potential loss over a specified time horizon under normal market conditions. By examining the contribution of each asset to the portfolio's VaR, I identified which stocks pose the greatest risk to the overall portfolio.

In summary, this project involved a rigorous analysis of stock data using Excel, encompassing expected returns, volatility, correlations, portfolio optimization, beta calculation, and VaR estimation. By leveraging these quantitative techniques, investors can make informed decisions regarding portfolio construction, risk management, and performance evaluation in the dynamic landscape of financial markets.
